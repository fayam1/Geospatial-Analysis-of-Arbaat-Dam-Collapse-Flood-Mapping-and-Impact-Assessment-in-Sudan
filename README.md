# Geospatial Analysis of Arbaat Dam Collapse: Flood Mapping and Impact Assessment in Sudan
# Project Description:
On August 25, 2024, the Arbat Dam in Sudan's Red Sea State collapsed due to intense rainfall, releasing millions of cubic meters of water downstream. This disaster exacerbated the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Sudan, which has been experiencing severe flooding since August 1, 2024, and has been embroiled in a 16-month civil conflict. This project utilized Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to map the flood extent before and after the dam collapse, assessing the impact on the region using integrated analysis of flood extent, land cover data, and infrastructure information.

# Tasks:
1- Satellite image (Sentinel-1 SAR) processing for pre-event (01-05-2024 to 10-05-2024) and post-collapse (25-08-2024 to 31-08-2024) periods.

2- Flood extent delineation for both time periods.

3- Change detection analysis to identify newly flooded areas post-dam collapse.

4- Flood damage assessment: Estimation of affected land cover areas and impacted infrastructure.

5- Map production and interpretation of results.

# Tools/Software:
- Python (geemap, Google Earth Engine, pandas, geopandas, numpy)

- Jupyter Lab

# Results/Conclusions
## 1-Flood Extent:

- Pre-collapse flood extent: 7.24 square kilometers

- Post-collapse flood extent: 14.23 square kilometers

- Increase in flooded area: 96.4% 

## 2-Land Cover Impacts:

- Agricultural land was affected, with 1.28 square kilometers flooded

- Grasslands and shrublands accounted for 0.02 and 0.95 square kilometers of inundated area, respectively

- Urban areas covering 0.02 square kilometers were also impacted by the floodwaters

- The most area in the flood extent is bare / sparse vegetation

- Infrastructures such as roads and bridges are also affected, which could cut off the affected population from other parts of the country and make rescue operations challenging.


## 3.Interactive Web Map :

To enhance the accessibility and impact of our findings, I developed an interactive web map that visualizes the flood extent and its impacts:

- Users can toggle between pre-collapse and post-collapse flood extents

- The map includes zoom functionality for detailed area inspection

- Geo-tagged photos of impacted areas provide ground-level perspectives

- Embedded videos showcase the scale of the disaster and ongoing relief efforts

- Detailed information on affected regions is accessible through interactive elements

- The map integrates multiple data layers including flood extent, land cover, and infrastructure

### This interactive tool serves as a powerful resource for:

- Disaster response teams to identify priority areas

- Policymakers to understand the full scope of the impact

- Researchers and analysts to conduct further studies

- Public awareness and education about the disaster's extent and consequences

This project demonstrates the crucial role of geospatial technologies in rapid disaster response and impact assessment. The combination of detailed analytical results with an interactive, multimedia web map provides a comprehensive understanding of the Arbaat Dam collapse's humanitarian implications. These insights can inform immediate humanitarian aid efforts, long-term resilience planning in Sudan, and serve as a model for future disaster response strategies.
